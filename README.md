# PyGB
A simple, easy to use grade book script.

PyGB (short for Python GradeBook) started off as a Python3 script to help me keep track of grades in a freshman-level "Career Exploration" class. As a TA, I did not have access to my university's main gradebook software, so I created PyGB as an excersie in using XML and Python together. After the class ended, I decided to continue with the project in order familiarize myself with GitHub.

=== INSTALLATION AND USE ===

NOTE: PyGB currently only supports Python3. If you do not have Python3 installed, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest version.

MAC OSX
    - To start the script, open Terminal and set your directory to the location of the PyGB folder using the `cd ` command.
    - Still in Terminal, type in `python3 gradebook.py`.
    - The script will prompt you to choose an XML file containing grading information.
